## Palenight Improved Workspace Indicator

Gnome shell extension that provides a workspace indicator more similar to i3/sway. 

Namely:

- it shows all _in use_ workspaces
- it highlights the currently active workspace

The workspace indicator color has been modified from [MichaelAquilina's original improved-workspace-indicator](https://github.com/MichaelAquilina/improved-workspace-indicator) to a palenight palette.
